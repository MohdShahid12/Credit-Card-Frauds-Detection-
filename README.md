1.Project Title:
Credit Card Frauds Detection.
  
2.DescriptiCredit card fraud is a significant problem, with billions of dollars lost each year.
Machine learning can be used to detect credit card fraud by identifying patterns that are indicative of fraudulent transactions. 
Credit card fraud refers to the physical loss of a credit card or the loss of sensitive credit card information.
Many machinelearning algorithms can be used for detection.This project proposes to develop a machine-learning model to detect credit card fraud.

4.Usage
Boost security; cut losses with machine learning.
Features: real-time monitoring, alerts for credit card transactions. Visualize data distributions and model predictions

5.Conclusion
The credit card fraud detection project uses machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions.
It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to distinguish between legitimate and suspicious activity.
Visualization helps uncover patterns, and basic models show reasonable accuracy.
Future improvements can enhance performance and real-time detection.
